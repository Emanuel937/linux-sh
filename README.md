## Example: Linux Structure Overview

Linux is organized as a **hierarchical filesystem**, starting from the root `/` directory.  
Some main directories:

- `/bin` → essential binaries (ls, cp, mv…)  
- `/boot` → files needed to boot Linux  
- `/etc` → configuration files  
- `/home` → user directories  
- `/lib` → system libraries  
- `/usr` → user programs and data  
- `/var` → variable data like logs or databases  

For detailed explanations, see the [`linux-structure/overview.md`](linux-structure/overview.md) file.
